 * run sequentially, so that side effects from one hook can be used

 * A hook which fails stop the process and error from stderr are used
 * for the reason of the failing.
 * A failed hook is decided by the return code: 0 mean success, anything
 * else is a failure.
 *
 * Hooks are asynchronously executed by default, in a Future.
