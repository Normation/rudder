= Rudder language

== Language

This language is not:

- a general purpose language
- a turing complete language
- an imperative language

It has no:

- recursion
- generator / generic iterator
- way of looping except on finite list

This language is only targeted at *state definition*.

Everything that is not a state definition is a convenience for easier definition of a state.

The compiler is very pedantic to avoid defining invalid states as much as possible.

== Concepts

=== Resource

- a resource is an object that sits on the system being configured
- a resource is defined by a resource type with 0 or more parameters
- a resource type with 0 parameter defines a unique resource in the system
- a resource can contain other resources

== State

- a state is an elementary configuration of a resource
- a state is defined by a name and 0 or more parameter
- a given resource can have many states at the same time
- a given resource can only have one state of a given name 
- state application produces a status also named outcome

=== Variables and types

- Configurations can be parametered via constants and variables.
- constants and variables have a type
- types are distincts from resource and state
- types are all based on basic types: `integer`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`, `array`, `hashmap`
- a variable cannot contain a resource or a state

=== Enums and conditions

- an enum is an exaustive list of possible value
- an anum mapping maps all possible values of an enum to another enum
- a condition is an enum expression
- an enum expression is a boolean expression of enum comparison
- enum comparison compares a variable with an enum value with mapping knowledge
- state application outcome are enums too
- a `case` is a list of conditions that must match all possible cases exactly once
- an `if` is a single condition


== Tests

=== Required modules
- perl (script: *tools/generate-lib*)
    cpan Config::IniFiles
=== Configuration
- *rudderc.conf* to define the cfengine and ncf binaries paths, and the compilation, translation paths
