= Rudder language

alias _rudder-lang_

== Preface

=== Language Presentation

This language is not:

* a general purpose language
* a Turing-complete language
* an imperative language

It has no:

* recursion
* generator / generic iterator
* way of looping except on finite list

This language is an _Open Source_  _DSL_ (_domain-specific language_) targeted at *state definition*.
Everything that is not a state definition is a convenience for easier definition of a state.
The compiler is very pedantic to avoid defining invalid states as much as possible.

File extension is `rl` for *Rudder Language*.

Example:

.ntp.rl
[source,rudder-lang]
----
include::examples/ntp.rl[]
----

Once compiled to _CFEngine_ code:

.ntp.rl.cf
[source,cfengine]
----
include::examples/documentation_ntp.rl.cf[]
----
// TODO: comparison with CFEngine, Puppet (mgmt ?)

==== Short-term future abilities

* Generate techniques written in _rudder-lang_ into: _DSC_
* Generate techniques written in _rudder-lang_ into: _JSON_
* Error feedback directly in the _Technique Editor_
* Enhanced (or refactored):
** Variable handling (for example in conditions)
** _CFEngine_ generation

==== Long-term future abilities

* New keywords including the _action_, _measure_, _function_ keywords
* Fully rewrite the ncf library into a self-sufficient _rudder-lang_ library
* Plain integration and usage of _rudder-lang_ into _Rudder_ whether as code or into the _Technique Editor_
* Various improvements and some reworks

== Standard library

By default, resource and state parameters:

* cannot be empty
* cannot contain only white-spaces
* have a max size of 16384 chars

Exceptions are explicitly specified in the doc.

States marked as actions represent actions that will be executed
at every run. You should generally add a condition when using them.
