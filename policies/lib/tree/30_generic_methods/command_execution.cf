# @name Command execution
# @description Execute a command
# @action
# @documentation
#
# Execute the **Command** in shell.
#
# On Unix based agents, the method status will report:
#
# * a **Repaired** if the return code is "0"
# * an **Error** if the return code is not "0"
#
# On Windows based agents the command is executed through Powershell and its `&` operator.
# The method status will report:
#
# * an **Error** in Audit mode as the command will not be executed
# * an **Error** in Enforce mode if the command did throw an exception
# * an **Error** in Enforce mode if the `LASTEXITCODE` of the execution was not 0. This can happen when calling '.exe' binaries for instance.
# * a **Repaired** in any other cases
#
# Do not use the "exit" command on Windows as the shell used is the same than the one running the agent!
#
# # Windows examples
#
# ```
# # A simple command execution
# Write-Output "rudder test" | Out-File "C:\test.txt
#
# # Another one with a statement, will report a Repaired if the folder exists,
# # and an error if it does not.
