# @name Service action
# @description Trigger an action on a service using the appropriate tool
# @action is-* commands are not actions, but all other commands are
#
# @documentation The `service_*` methods manage the services running on the system.
#
# #### Parameters
#
# ##### Service name
#
# The name of the service is the name understood by the service manager, except for the
# `is-active-process` action, where it is the regex to match against the running processes list.
#
# ##### Action
#
# The action is the name of an action to run on the given service.
# The following actions can be used:
#
# * `start`
# * `stop`
# * `restart`
# * `reload` (or `refresh`)
# * `is-active` (or `status`)
# * `is-active-process` (in this case, the "service" parameter is the regex to match against process list)
# * `enable`
# * `disable`
# * `is-enabled`
#
# Other actions may also be used, depending on the selected service manager.
#
# #### Implementation
#
# These methods will detect the method to use according to the platform. You can run the methods with an `info`
# verbosity level to see which service manager will be used for a given action.
#
# WARNING: Due to compatibility issues when mixing calls to systemctl and service/init.d,
# when an init script exists, we will not use systemctl compatibility layer but directly service/init.d.
#
# The supported service managers are:
#
# * systemd (any unknown action will be passed directly)
# * upstart
# * smf (for Solaris)
# * service command (for non-boot actions, any unknown action will be passed directly)
# * /etc/init.d scripts (for non-boot actions, any unknown action will be passed directly)
# * SRC (for AIX) (for non-boot actions)
# * chkconfig (for boot actions)
# * update-rc.d (for boot actions)
# * chitab (for boot actions)
# * links in /etc/rcX.d (for boot actions)
# * Windows services
#
# #### Examples
#
# ```
# # To restart the apache2 service
# service_action("apache2", "restart");
# service_restart("apache2");
# ```
#
# @parameter name Name of the service
# @parameter action Action to trigger on the service (start, stop, restart, reload, ...)
#
# 
# @parameter_rename service_name name
# @class_prefix service_action
# @class_parameter name
# @agent_support = ["cfengine-community"]
