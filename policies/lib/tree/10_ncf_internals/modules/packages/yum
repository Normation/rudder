def repo_install():
    # Due to how yum works we need to split repo installs into several
    # components.
    #
    # 1. Installation of fresh packages is easy, we add all of them on one
    #    command line.
    # 2. Upgrade of existing packages where no version has been specified is
    #    also easy, we add that to the same command line.
    # 3. Up/downgrade of existing packages where version is specified is
    #    tricky, for several reasons:
    #      a) There is no one yum command that will do both, "install" or
    #         "upgrade" will only upgrade, and "downgrade" will only downgrade.
    #      b) There is no way rpm or yum will tell you which version is higher
    #         than the other, and we know from experience with the old package
    #         promise implementation that we don't want to try to do such a
    #         comparison ourselves.
    #      c) yum has no dry-run mode, so we cannot tell in advance which
    #         operation will succeed.
    #      d) yum will not even tell you whether operation succeeded when you
    #         run it for real
    #
    # So here's what we need to do. We start by querying each package to find
    # out whether that exact version is installed. If it fulfills 1. or 2. we
    # add it to that single command line.
    #
    # If we end up at 3. we need to split the work and do each package
    # separately. We do:
    #
    # 1. Try to upgrade using "yum upgrade".
    # 2. Query the package again, see if it is the right version now.
    # 3. If not, try to downgrade using "yum downgrade".
    # 4. Query the package again, see if it is the right version now.
    # 5. Final safeguard, try installing using "yum install". This may happen
    #    in case we have one architecture already, but we are installing a
    #    second one. In this case only install will work.
    # 6. (No need to check again, CFEngine will do the final check)
    #
    # This is considerably more expensive than what we do for apt, but it's the
    # only way to cover all bases. In apt it will be one apt call for any number
    # of packages, with yum it will in the worst case be:
    #   1 + 5 * number_of_packages
    # although a more common case will probably be:
    #   1 + 2 * number_of_packages
    # since it's unlikely that people will do a whole lot of downgrades
    # simultaneously.
