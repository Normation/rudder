//! Implementation of CFEngine's custom promise protocol
//!
//! This library is a Rust implementation of the
//! [custom promise protocol](https://github.com/cfengine/core/blob/master/docs/custom_promise_types/modules.md),
//! added in CFEngine 3.17.
//!
//! This library targets CFEngine 3.18 LTS or later.
//!
//! It uses the JSON variant of the protocol, and allows easily implementing promise types in
//! Rust with a type-safe and idiomatic interface.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Design is inspired by the [reference Python and shell implementations](https://github.com/cfengine/core/blob/master/docs/custom_promise_types).
//!
//! The main goal is to provide a reliable interface, by checking as much stuff as we can
//! (including parameters types, etc.) to allow easily implementing safe and fast promise types.
//! Note that we do not try to stick too close to the underlying protocol, and prefer
//! an idiomatic way when possible.
//!
//! This lib is done with Rudder use cases in mind, so we have a special focus on the audit mode (warn only).
//! In this order, we split the *evaluate* step into *check* and *apply*
//! to handle warn-only mode at executor level and avoid having to implement it in every promise.
//!
//! The library is built around a trait describing a promise type's interface, and an executor
//! that handles the stdin/stdout communication and protocol serialization.
