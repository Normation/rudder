# #############################################################################
# # To use a different certificate/port/configuration for Web/API access and 
# # and node communication, comment the default virtual host and uncomment and
# # modify the following configuration.
# #
# # This is useful for:
# # 
# # * using a different certificate for the web UI/API
# # * separating the network flows for security reasons
# #
# # You will need a criteria to match the requests in the right virtual host,
# # either a different port or a properly configured ServerName.
# #
# # If the 2 VirtualHosts share the same IP address and port, and cannot be
# # differentiated by the “VirtualHost” statement : 
# # - The DNS name, if any, that is configured on the nodes as Policy Server
# #   must be used as “ServerName” for the nodes communication vhost.
# #   If the nodes use the server's IP address as Policy Server, then use
# #   the IP address for “ServerName”.
# # - 127.0.0.1 must be specified as “ServerAlias" for the Node Communication
# #   vhost, as the Rudder agent that runs on the Rudder server itself uses
# #   127.0.0.1 as policy server.
# # - It is good practice to also use the actual server's IP address as a
# #   “ServerAlias" for node communication, so the nodes can access the server
# #   with a Policy Server configured either to its DNS name or IP address.
# #
# # - The hostname used for accessing the Web server interface and API must be
# #   specified as "ServerName" for the Web/API vhost.
