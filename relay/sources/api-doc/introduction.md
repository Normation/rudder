# Introduction

Rudder relay exposes an internal API, enabling the agents and other services to interact with the relay.

A part of the API (everything but the `System` category) is exposed publicly on the relay
at `https://relay.example.com/rudder/relay-api/` (which is a reverse proxy of
`http://localhost:3030/rudder/relay-api/1/`).

## Authentication

The relay API is authenticated on a case-by-case basis:

* *Remote run* is only accessible to requests from the IP of the relay's own policy server

* *Shared files* checks file signature based on known public keys from nodes

* *Shared folder* is only available to nodes in the authorized networks

* *System* is only accessible to local clients and do not permit access to private information nor modification abilities

## Versioning

Each time the API is extended with new features (new functions, new parameters, new responses, ...), it will be assigned a new version number. This will allow you to keep your existing scripts (based on previous behavior). Versions will always be integers (no 2.1 or 3.3, just 2, 3, 4, ...).
You can change the version of the API used by setting in the URL: each URL is prefixed by its version id, like `/relay-api/version/action`.
In the future, we may declare some versions as deprecated, in order to remove them in a later version of Rudder, but we will never remove any versions without warning, or without a safe period of time to allow migration from previous versions.

### Existing versions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 20%">Version</th>
      <th style="width: 20%">Rudder version it appeared in</th>
      <th style="width: 70%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">(none)</td>
      <td class="code">3.2</td>
      <td>Unversioned API providing remote-run, shared-files and shared-folder</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">1</td>
      <td class="code">6.0</td>
      <td>First relay API with a version</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


## Response format

The *System* API and future endpoints use JSON with the following schema:

```json
  {
    "action": The name of the called function,
    "result": The result of your action: success or error,
    "data": Only present if this is a success and depends on the function, it's usually a JSON object,
    "errorDetails": Only present if this is an error, it contains the error message
  }
```
