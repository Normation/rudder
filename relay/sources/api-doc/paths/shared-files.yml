  summary: Get the state a file in the shared files
  description: >-
    Get the state of a given file from the the shared files of the policy
    server, typically to check if it needs to be sent. Note that contrary
    to what you could expect, the `Content-Length` and `Content-Type`
    headers will not match what you would get with a *GET* call on the same
    file.

  summary: Upload a shared file
  description: >-
    Shares a file, along with metadata and a ttl. The request body is a the
    concatenation of the metadata (containing the signature) with the file content,
    separated by an empty line. The receiving relay will either directly share it
    if the target node is a sub node, or forward the request to the appropriate
    relay (sub relay or upstream depending if it is under the current relay or not).
