Language
========

This language is not:
- a general purpose language
- a turing complete language
- an imperative language

It has no:
- recussion
- generator / generic iterator
- way of looping except on finite list

This language is only targeted at STATE DEFINITION

Everything that is not a state definition is a convenience for easier definition of a state.

Concepts
========

Resource
--------

- a resource is an object that sits on the system being configured
- a resource is defined by a resource type with 0 or more parameters
- a resource type with 0 parameter defines a unique resource in the system
- a resource can contain other resources

State
-----

- a state is an elementary configuration of a resource
- a state is defined by a name and 0 or more parameter
- a given resource can have many states at the same time
- a given resource can only have one state of a given name 
- state application produces a status also named outcome

Variables and types
-------------------

- Configurations can be parametered via constants and variables.
- constants and variables have a type
- types are distincts from resource and state
- types are all based on basic types: integer, float, string, boolean, array, hashmap
- a variable cannot contain a resource or a state

Enums and conditions
--------------------

- an enum is an exaustive list of possible value
- an anum mapping maps all possible values of an enum to another enum
- a condition is an enum expression
- an enum expression is a boolean expression of enum comparison
- enum comparison compares a variable with an enum value with mapping knowledge
- state application outcome are enums too
- a 'case' is a list of conditions that must match all possible cases exactly once
- an 'if' is a single condition
