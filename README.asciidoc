Continuous configuration for effective compliance
-------------------------------------------------

Rudder is an easy to use, web-driven, role-based solution for IT Infrastructure
Automation & Compliance.

The workflow offers different users options at their own level:

*  Non-expert users can define parameters in a central interface, and Rudder will
   automatically make sure that your IT services are installed, configured, running
   and in good health. All actions (checks, warnings, fixed errors…) are reported upon
   immediately in the user interface, keeping drift from nominal behaviour low.
*  Expert users can configure how to implement these parameters on different systems,
   or build upon the pre-defined library provided using the CLI or API.
*  Managers can consult compliance reports and access audit logs.

Rudder is an established project with several 10000s of node managed, in companies
from small to biggest-in-their-field. Typical deployments manage 100s to 1000s of nodes.
The biggest known deployment in 2016 is about 7000 nodes.

=== Feature overview

Key features are detailed https://docs.rudder.io/reference/5.0/key_features.html[here], but
some of them are: 

* Web interface to manage nodes and define policies
* Continuously assesses drift compared to defined policies (with or without auto-healing)
* Optionally, continuously enforces configuration over time (configuring once is good,
  ensuring configuration is always valid and automatically fixing it is better)
* Inventory of all managed nodes
* Compliance reporting, by configuration and/or by node, with possibility to
  drill down in non-compliance issues to identify the root problem.
* Automate common system administration tasks (installation, configuration)
* Full REST API to interact with the Rudder server


TIP: Rudder is open source – we welcome ideas, comments, criticism, patches and
any other contributions! So get https://chat.rudder.io/[chatting with our community]

=== Testing and installing Rudder

==== 5 minute tests

===== Demo site

You can see a demo version of Rudder: http://demo.rudder-project.org/

===== Vagrant

Just want to test Rudder without worrying about a full installation, but with real
virtual machines so that you can actually configure and test things, unlike
the demo? We provide a https://github.com/Normation/rudder-vagrant[Vagrant set-up].
See https://www.rudder-project.org/site/get-rudder/vagrant/[Rudder Vagrant page]
for getting started with Rudder on Vagrant.

===== Rudder Test Framework (rtf)

Rudder test framework is a tool that allows to define full environnements and set
them up for you. For example, you can define a platform with a Rudder server on
Debian stable, 2 nodes on CentOS connected to it, and a Rudder Relay Server with
its own 2 Debian nodes in 3 lines of configuration and commands.

See https://github.com/Normation/rudder-tests for more information.

==== Installing on real environments

===== Linux server packages

The easiest way to test and use Rudder for prototyping or production is to install
it from the provided Linux packages.
For the server, the main current .rpm-based (RedHat, CentOS, SLES) and .deb-based
(Debian, Ubuntu) distributions are supported. See https://www.rudder-project.org/site/get-rudder/downloads/
for details about repository and available versions.

===== Rudder agent packages

Rudder agent is extremely versatile and packages are available for a wide range of
versions of RedHat, CentOS, SLES, Debian and Ubuntu (like RHEL3 or Debian
Lenny).

It works on other distributions as well, like Slackware, Raspbian and other
embedded Linux on ARM/x86, Android, FreeBSD but no ready-to-use packages are provided today.

Normation offers AIX, Solaris and Windows agents.

.On a more 'developer oriented' usage on this repository only (not as Rudder as a whole):

This Scala web application is managed with Maven software project management (http://maven.apache.org/).
You will need a working Maven 3.x.x installation.

.Clean, build and install on your local repository:

We are working on a public artefact repository for Rudder, so for now you will
need to build all dependencies for the Scala web application yourself.
You can create a script with the following lines:

----
$ echo clone-build-rudder.sh
----

----
#!/bin/sh
BASE="$PWD"
REPOS="rudder-parent-pom rudder-commons scala-ldap ldap-inventory rudder"
for i in ${REPOS}; do
    echo "\e[0;32mCloning ${i}\e[0m"
    git clone https://github.com/Normation/$i.git
    P=${BASE}/${i}
    cd ${P}
    echo "\e[0;32mBuilding ${P}\e[0m"
    mvn install
done
