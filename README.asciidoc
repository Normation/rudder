Rudder is an easy to use, web-driven, role-based solution for IT Infrastructure Automation & Compliance.

The workflow offers different users options at their own level:

*  Non-expert users can define parameters in a central console, and Rudder will automatically make sure that your IT services are installed, configured, running and in good health. All actions (checks, warnings, fixed errors…) are reported upon immediately in the user interface, keeping drift from nominal behaviour low.
*  Expert users can configure how to implement these parameters on different systems, or build upon the pre-defined library provided.
*  Managers can consult compliance reports and access audit logs.

Rudder combines the power of some of the best-of-breed open source tools in the field, adding reporting and higher level features to keep an eye on your IT: http://www.ncf.io/[the ncf framework] and http://cfengine.com/[CFEngine configuration management agent], http://www.fusioninventory.org/[the FusionInventory hardware and software inventory tool], reporting and higher level features to keep an eye on your information system. Rudder’s web interface is developed in Scala. 


TIP: Rudder is open source – we welcome ideas, comments, criticism, patches and any other contributions! So let's get a chat we our community https://www.rudder-project.org/site/support/chat-mailing-lists/[on irc]!


=== Feature overview

* Automate common system administration tasks (installation, configuration)
* Enforce configuration over time (configuring once is good, ensuring that configuration is valid and automatically fixing it is better)
* Inventory of all managed nodes
* Web interface to configure and manage nodes and their configuration
* Compliance reporting, by configuration and/or by node
* Full API to interact with Rudder server

.For a more 'developer oriented' usage.

This project is managed thanks to Maven software project management (http://maven.apache.org/). 
You will have to have a working Maven 3.0.x installation.

.Clean, build and install on your local repository:
----
% mvn clean install
----

For now, the development environment is not trivial to set-up. We want to 
make it more easy so that an unique command will set-up the full environment, 
but we are afraid that until that bright future become true, you will have to
follow: http://www.rudder-project.org/foswiki/Development/SettingUpADevelopmentEnvironment
