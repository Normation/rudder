# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security advisories

Our [advisories are published on GitHub](https://github.com/Normation/rudder/security/advisories),
all linked to the main `rudder` repository.

## ✉️ Reporting a vulnerability

You can report any security vulnerability affecting Rudder sources, packages, or infrastructure
(repositories, websites, etc.) you have found by contacting the Rudder security team either:

* By email at [security@rudder.io](mailto:security@rudder.io)
  * 🔑 You can encrypt your messages using our [GPG key](https://repository.rudder.io/tools/rudder-security.asc)
(fingerprint: `340C 9645 2F9A 816C 330A 99B7 C854 668E 3617 3DB3`)
* By using [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Normation/rudder/security/advisories/new) on GitHub

If you have not received a reply to your report within 48 hours, you can ask for updates on
our [chat room](https://chat.rudder.io). As it is a public channel, please don't discuss
specific details there, simply say you are waiting for a response from the security team.

## 📆 Vulnerability disclosure

Security issues are treated in priority. Depending on its severity, an issue may be fixed in the
next planned patch release or trigger a quick dedicated patch release.

When the fixed version is published, we mention the presence of security fixes (without specifics)
in the change log. We later publish a detailed advisory, after an embargo period which depends on the vulnerability
severity (but never more than 3 months).

## 🏷️ Supported Versions

The list of currently supported versions, receiving security updates, is available
[in the documentation](https://docs.rudder.io/versions).
