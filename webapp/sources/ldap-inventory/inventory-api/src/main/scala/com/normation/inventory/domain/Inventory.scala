/**
 * Define what an inventory file can contain
 * An inventory is done for one operating system (the server),
 * on at most one container (the underlying machine, physical or virtual).
 * These object may be link too some software and other virtual machine
 * (hosted on the server)
 *
 * The first returned value (the String) is the Device_id.
 * It is a sequel of OCSi/Fusion xml file, and perhaps should be removed.
 *
 * The OperatingSystem is an {@code OperatingSystem} object with as much information
 * that we gathered
 *
 * The third returned value holds the (perhaps multiple) containers of that server.
 * At this point, we don't really now if they are bare machine or Virtual ones.
 *
 * The last returned values holds the VMs that are running atop this OS. They may
 * (of course) be empty.
