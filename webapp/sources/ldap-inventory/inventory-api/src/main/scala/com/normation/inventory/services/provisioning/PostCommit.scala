/**

 *
 * By convention, a PostCommit which return:
 * - Full : continue the pipeline processing. AT LEAST input
 *          records have to be returned (kind of forward to
 *          the next postCommit)
 * - Empty or Failure : interrupt pipeline processing (following
 *                      PostCommits won't happened)
 *
 *
 * The R parameter is the return type of the back-end.
 * Ideally, it should be only diff actually applied to the back-end,
 * but it could be the new entity is the store can not provide
 * better information (LDAP can).
