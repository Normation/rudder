                Optional merge algo of the import. Default `override-all` means what is in the archive is the new reality. 
                `keep-rule-targets` will keep existing target definition for existing rules (ignore archive value).
                `ignore-source-targets` is like `keep-rule-targets` but in addition sets an empty target for new rules.
