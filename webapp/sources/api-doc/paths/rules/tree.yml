                        This Rule was created automatically when Rudder was installed.
                        It can be used to target Directives to all nodes (including the Rudder root server
                        itself), or deleted if you would rather create your own set of Rules (it will
                        never be created again).

                        - bff45fe2-8233-4d28-96aa-78b0390b548b
