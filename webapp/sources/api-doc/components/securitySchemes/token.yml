    Authenticating against the API is mandatory for every request, as sensitive information like inventories or configuration rules may get exposed.
    It is done using a dedicated API Account, than can be created in the web interface on the 'API Accounts' page located inside the Administration part.

    API Accounts are not linked to standard user accounts, and currently give full administrative privileges: they must be secured adequately.
    Once you have created an API account, you get a token that will be needed to authenticate every request. This token is the API equivalent of a password, and must
    be secured just like a password would be.


    On any call to the API, you will need to add a **X-API-Token** header to your request to authenticate:


        curl --request GET --header "X-API-Token: yourToken" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules


    If you perform any action (creation, update, deletion) using the API, the event log generated will record the API account as the user.
