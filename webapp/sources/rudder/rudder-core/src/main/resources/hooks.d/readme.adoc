= Generalities about hooks

*Hooks are organized in subdirectories*. The root of the sub-directories is `/opt/rudder/etc/hooks.d/`

Each sub-directory has a name related to the event that will trigger the hooks
execution.
By default, a hook directory contains a template example and a Readme.txt file
explaining the generalities about hooks and the specificities of that hook (parameters, etc).

*Hooks must be executable*. All executable files will be used as hooks EXCEPT if
they end with one of the extensions listed in */opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties
for property *rudder.hooks.ignore-suffixes*. A common convention is to use the *.disabled*
suffix to do so.

Non executable files will be ignored (which allows to put other files in these
directories, like a readme, for example).


*Hooks parameter are passed by environment variable*. Rudder will fill dedicated
environment variable for each hook.

*Hooks are executed sequentially, in lexical order*. We encourage
you to use the patter "NN-hookname", with NN a number like
"05", "20", etc.

*Hooks have normalized returned code*. Return codes on hooks are interpreted as follow:

- 0      : success, no log (apart if debug one)          , continue to next hook
- 1-31   : error  , error   log in /var/log/rudder/webapp/, stop processing
- 32-63  : warning, warning log in /var/log/rudder/webapp/, continue to next hook
- 64-255 : reserved for future use case. Behavior may change without notice.

*Hooks have a maximum execution time allowed*. After some time (2s for policy generation node specific events, 30s for
other cases) a warning will be issued. After a longer time (20s for policy generation node specific
events, 5 min for other cases), the hook will be killed.
You can change these timeouts with the following directives, that must be in the 1000 first characters of your hook script,
prefixed by any type of comments characters (only the end of line is considered):

- HOOK_WARN_TIMEOUT = <length><unit>
- HOOK_KILL_TIMEOUT = <length><unit>

Where `length` is an integer, and `unit` is one of `micro(s)`, `ms`, `millisecond(s)`, `s`,
`second(s)`, `m`, `minute(s)`, `h`, `hour(s)`.

*Available Hooked events*: for now, all hooks are related to different steps of the policy generation
process or node lifecycle and inventory reception. In the future, more cases will be supported.
