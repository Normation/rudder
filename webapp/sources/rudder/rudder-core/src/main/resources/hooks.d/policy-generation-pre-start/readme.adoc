= policy-generation-pre-start

== When/What ?

This directory contains hooks executed before policy generation.

Typically, these hooks are used to check the integrity of techniques.

An error during the execution in one of them will stop policy generation, preventing deployment of new policies until the hook succeeds.

== Parameters

Hooks parameters are passed by environment variable:

- RUDDER_GENERATION_DATETIME: generation datetime: ISO-8601
YYYY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.sssZ date/time that identify that policy generation.
