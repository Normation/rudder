/*
 * Two way of modeling the couple (directiveId, rev) :
 * - either we do DirectiveId(uuid: String, rev: Rev).
 *   We tell that the revision is part of the directive identifier, and that an identifier
 *   always has a revision.
 *   It is likely the solution that will make simpler to never forget the migration from
 *   id = uuid to id = (uuid, rev). But:
 *   - it may complexify some automatic derivation, for ex for JSON (ie either we change json format for
 *     "directive": { "id": {"uuid":"xxxxx", "rev": "xxxxx" }, ... }
 *     which is breaking change for no good reason, especially if we want to make "rev" (or "rev") optionnal
 * - or we just add a "rev" (or "rev") field in directive. It doesn't break any existing serialisation API, it
 *   allows to continue to speak about "the directive ID" as just the uuid part, and have rev in addition.
 *   But it means that we will need to be extra-careful to not forget a place that for now use "id" and that will
 *   need to be duplicated or augmented with an optionnal "rev" parameter.
 *
 * I *think* we should change as little serialisation format as possible, especially in API, because they are the worst
 * breaking changes possible, and from an external observer, not providing rev should let everything work as before.
 * So we should make a hard constraint that JSON API will remain the same (with possibly an added "rev" field).
 *
 * Given that, we should (at least in the begining) try to minize distance between API serialisation format and internal
 * format. So go for the second option, and be careful when evolving methods.
 *
 * ==== some more evolution
 *
 * - forcing rev everywhere, when we want it to be almost always `DEFAULT_REV`, is not efficient. We should use
 *   Option[Rev]
 *   BUT it means that special attention need to be used on unserialisation: defaultValue (if serialised)
 *   must be unserialized to `None`.
 * - the code is crying for a DirectiveRId(id: DirectiveId, rev: Option[Rev] = None)
 *
 * ==== case of techniques
 *
 * Techniques already have a version as part of their ID. That version is different from our revision, as it is not strict.
 * But it seems that our revision is more a complement than a totally other concept:
 * - two techniques with a difference here must have different directories for files/etc
 * - directives with different version can't be merged/etc
 *
 *
