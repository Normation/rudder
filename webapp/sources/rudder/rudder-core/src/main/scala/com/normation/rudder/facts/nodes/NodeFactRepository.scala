/*
 * This file contains the base to persist facts into a git repository. There is a lot of question
 * remaning, so don't take current traits/classes as an API, it *WILL* change. The basic questions to answer are:
 * - do we want one bit "FactRepo" that knows about all kind of facts and is able to persis any of them ? In that case,
 *   we will need some kind of parametrization of `persist` with a type class to teach that repo how to serialize and
 *   persist each case
 * - do we prefer lots of small repos, one by entity, which knows how to persist only that entity ?
 * - plus, we want to have some lattitude on the serialization part, and be able to use both liftjson and zio-json
 *   (because the complete migration toward zio-json won't be finish immediately)
 *
 * The "one big" repo feels more like it is what we need, since it's really just one big git repo with subcases,
 * with shared tools and specialisation by entity. But I'm not sure how to build the capacities with type class
 * until I have several examples.
 * The small repos (one by entity) is what we used to do, so we are in known territory (see archive of configuration
 * entities), even if it is not a very satisfying one. Its advantage is that it's very simple, but it leads to a lot
 * of code duplication and maintenance is complicated (and adding a new entity is basically "copy that 100 lines of
 * code, and sed things", while we would like it to be "implement just that interface")
 *
 * Finally, we some coupling between serialization and repos as they are written for now: the path can't be known
 * without some part of the entity, but we don't know which part exactly (for node, it's its uuid and status, but
 * perhaps it's an exception, and for all other it's just an ID).
 *
 * With all these unknowns, I prefer to let parametrisation as simple as possible:
 * - no abstraction for repo, we just have a "node repo" with all the concret types. It's likely to become a:
 *   ```
 *     trait FactRepo { def persist[E](e: E)(implicit Serialize[E]): IOResult[Unit])
 *   ```
 *   Or something alike, but we just don't know.
 *
 * - some abstraction for serialisation, but just to put in plain sight the fact that there a caracteristic of
 *   the entity that is not the whole entity, and more then its ID, that is needed to build where the entity
 *   will be saved.
 *
 * - a simple implementation for nodes, that will need to be refactored depending of the chosen final arch.
 *
 * And finally, to complexify a bit more the picture, we see that there is events (observations?) linked to facts
 * that can update the previous fact partially. For nodes, it's "change the status" (which is, perhaps by luck,
 * the same subpart of the entity than the one used in the more-than-just-an-id parameter of serialization).
 * I don't know for now if it's a general truth, or if it's just an happenstance, and if there is a general
 * capability (like "partialUpdate[SomeSubParOfE => E]") to define (in a pure eventstore, we would save that
 * event as if, but well we want to have readable text files for users in our git repos)
