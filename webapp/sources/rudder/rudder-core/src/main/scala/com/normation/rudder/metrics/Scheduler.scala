 * Scheduler to write logs in file. We want to log a new status line when interesting
 * events happens, like a node is added or deleted, but not too often (once every
 * 10min is well enought: you can't really use rudder below that timespan), and
 * if nothing interesting happens, we still want to have a log line every once and
 * then (1h).
 * So we define a scheduler that calls a consumer (the actual logger) at most every
 * `min` time and at least every `max` time, with:
 * - min must be smaller than max strictly.
 * Consumer must handle its errors.
 * It uses a queue with one element only to notice not yet processed element.
 *
 * It should be created with `Scheduler.make` which check for parameters consistancy.
