 * There is a configuration file option, `rudder.technique.compiler.app` that let you override
 * the choice for what app write techniques globally (techniqueCompilerApp).
 *
 * Then, you can locally override the choice for one technique with a local file `compilation.yaml`
 * in which you can force to fallback to `rudder` -> `rudder-only-unix` -> `webapp`.
 *
 * Finally, when `rudderc` is used, the webapp will look for its return code and generated files.
 * When the return code is XXXX, or if generated files doesn't pass a sanity check, then
 * the webapp is used to generate things. We also update the `compilation.yaml` to reflect the fact
 * that the last compilation used a fallback app and the error (if any)
 *
 * In that two last cases, then a big red persistent message is displayed in the technique editor
 * with the fact that a fallback was used.
 * In the last case, in addition, we need to display to the user the problem that they need to report
 * to rudder dev.
