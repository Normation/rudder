 *  we want to retrieve for each node the expected reports that matches it LAST
 *  run, or if no last run, what we are wainting for.
 *
 *  So the general resolution for ONE node is:
 *  - 1/ context
 *  - get the last run
 *  - get the list of nodeConfigIdInfo
 *
 *  - 2/ get the config id and date
 *  - 2.1: from the run:
 *    - if we have it, find the option[date] matching that version
 *  - 2.2: else (no run), we get the last available from nodeinfo with date
 *    - if none, get the last expected reports for the node, but not configId/date for it
 *  - so, we have a configId and an option[date] of validity
 *    => get expectedReports
 *
 *  - now, get reports for the run if any, and compute merge.
 *
 *
 *  For a node, we will get:
 *
 *  - run date:
 *    - Some(t): the node at least talked to us!
 *    - None   : never talked, build a pending/noreport list
 *  - (configId, eol of that config):
 *    - Some(id): we know what we expect!
 *      - Some(date): we know the validity !: the simplest case
 *      - None: this is an unexpected version (no meta info on it). Error.
 *    - None: migration only, that case will disappear with time. Compat mode,
 *            consider expected report for the node are ok. Don't care of the (None) date.

/*
 * An ADT to describe the behaviour regarding Unexpected reports.
 * Unexpected reports are reports that the node sent but that were not
 * awaited in the expected configuration reporting.
 * There is mainly 4 causes for unexpected rerpots:
 * - a bug in a Technique that send a report when it should not. This is a really unexpected report, and
 *   shoud be reported to Technique maintener for correction.
 * - a Technique is executed when it should not. Typically, the node didn't fetch the updated version
 *   of its policies and it still report on the previous one. Real unexpectation.
 * - the network sneezed and syslog went mad. In such a case, we can miss reports or have some duplicated. Missing
 *   reports is embarassing, but syslog tries very hard to not do that, so we have more often duplicated ones.
 * - reports were on a part of the technique with a cfengine parameter which happened to be an iterator and
 *   so it was exectued several time, and there is as many reports. This case is expected, but in the general case,
 *   we don't have anything that allows to anticipate the number of reports sent back (and specific cases like "the
 *   number is available in a server-side known variable" are hard, too, because it means that we know to parse and
 *   interpret a lot more of cfengine gramar).
 *
 * The last two cases bring a lot of false positive bad compliance, and we want to let the user be able to
 * accept them. We want that to be optionnal, has in each cases, it could be real unexpected reports (but it's very
 * unlikely).
