<!--
  The username is case-sensitive by default, if you want to change this behaviour, you can
  change the parameter 'case-sensitivity' to 'false'

  The "authentication" tag should have a "hash" attribute, with these allowed values:
    "bcrypt", "md5", "sha1", "sha256", "sha-256", "sha512", "sha-512"

  It is advised to use 'bcrypt' (default since 6.1). When upgrading from previous
  releases, you need to reset all the passwords to bcrypt hashes and change the authentication tag.

  Not specifying the "hash" attribute means using plain text passwords, which is not
  advisable for security reasons.

  To create a bcrypt hash of your password, please run this command:
    htpasswd -nBC 12 "" | tr -d ':\n'

  To create a sha512 hash of your password, please run this command:
    read mypass; echo -n $mypass | sha512sum

  If you configured the use of LDAP or Active Directory in rudder-web.properties file,
  you still need to specify here one user entry by user, with both the "password"
  field (which will be ignored - it can be left empty) and the "role" field
  (where you define the actual authorisations of the user). The "hash" field of
  "authentication" can be omitted.

  The "roles" tag must contain one or more of these values (comma separated), depending
  on what the user should be allowed to do:
    "administrator" (all rights), "administration_only" (administration tab), "user"
    (all nodes, configuration tab), "configuration" (configuration tab), "read_only"
    (read everything), "compliance" (read rules, read nodes), "inventory" (read nodes), "validator"
    (can valid changes), "deployer" (can deploy changes), "workflow" (both deployer and validator)

  There is also the possibility to create "custom" roles by combining those elements:
    type: "node", "group", "deployment", "administration", "configuration", "rule", "technique"
    "directive", "parameter", "validator", "deployer",
    level: "read", "write", "edit", "all" (read, write, edit)

  Example: "node_read" (can read nodes), "validator_all" (same as validator).

  If the extended authorisations feature is enable, you can define custom roles. They are introduced by the `custom-roles`
  tag, and they allow to define new role name for set of roles or authorisations.
  A custom role is defined with the `<role>` tag with the attribute "name" (case-insensitive name of the role) and
  "roles" (same as for an user).
  Ex:
  <authentication>
    <custom-roles>
      <role name="role_a0" permissions="node_read,node_write,configuration"/>
      <role name="role_a1" permissions="ROLE_A0,inventory"/>
    </custom-roles>
  <authentication>


  Please take a look at Rudder's documentation for additional details, either from the
  application itself (upper right corner) or on
  https://docs.rudder.io/reference/current/administration/users.html

  IMPORTANT: After changing this file, the webapp needs to reload the user list.
  You can do it in the "User management" plugin or by restarting the webapp with:
  systemctl restart rudder-jetty
