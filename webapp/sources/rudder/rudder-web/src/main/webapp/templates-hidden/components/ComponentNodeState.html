        <p>A node can be assigned a state. State may be used to classify nodes (in search and groups).
           Some states have also an impact on what Rudder does for a node.</p>
        <p>By default, a node is in state <b>Enabled</b>.</p>
        <p>Available states are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Enabled</b>: this is the default state for a node. Rudder generate policies for that node based on Rules and Groups.
              The node is expected to report on these policies on each run, accordingly to its Policy Mode, Agen Run Schedule, and Compliance Mode.</li>
          <li><b>Initializing</b>: this state is equivalent to <b>Enabled</b> state but may be used to create specific Rules and Groups for new nodes.</li>
          <li><b>Preparing End Of Life</b>: this state is equivalent to <b>Enabled</b> state but may be used to create specific Rules and Groups for EOL nodes.</li>
          <li><b>Ignored</b>: Rudder ignore node is this state. No policy are generated for them, and they are excluded from compliance reporting. The agent
              for a node on that state doesn't get new policies, but it continues to runs as before. This state is typically used for a temporaly shutdowned
              machine, or for a node for which the policy generation is broken for some reasons and get be fixed for now.</li>
          <li><b>Empty policies</b>: When policies are generated, Rudder remove all non-system policies for nodes in this state. The agent continue to
              run, but only with system policies. By consequences, the node is excluded from all non-system policy compliance calculation. This state
              is perfect for a node which should not be managed by Rudder for a time but with the possibility to get back to managed without direct
              connection to the node.</li>
        </ol>
