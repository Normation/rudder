{-| We want to explain several cases, and we use several types,
we also don't bother modeling non-empty collections as the type already explains it all
(so, we are not modeling all edge cases of emptiness but only dispatching to the right case).

The case of "upgrade" is specific because it is merged with the "install", so we need to consider all case where
there could be upgrades, additionally to installs.

So, either :

  - we have no plugins/no triggered actions initally, so no exlanation
  - all plugins action are allowed, given an action context (outside of this data, but it can be enabled, etc., except installed)
  - all plugins actions are disallowed, plugins most likely have common reason to not be actionable, so we group them by error message
  - some plugins actions are disallowed, a merged case for the two case above
  - there are plugins install, and they are all allowed
  - there are plugins install, but there is also some warning
  - there are plugins upgrade, and they are all allowed
  - there are plugins upgrade, but there is also some warning
  - there are plugins install and upgrade, and they are all allowed
  - there are plugins install and upgrade, but there is also some warning
