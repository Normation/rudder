Developers documentation
========================


This documentation is a general documentation about developments rules for Rudder-web module. 


Where to start
--------------

You should have a basic understanding of the project layout, where things go. 
After that, bootstrap.liftweb.Boot and bootstrap.liftweb.AppConfig will give
you a summary of boot process, actions and services used. 

Snippets pages are mapped one to one with real application pages.


Packages

    * Lift bootstrap, in **Boot.scala**
    * Spring / DI configuration (AppConfig for all the weaving)
