<!-- 
 The "authentication" tag can have a "hash" argument, with these allowed values: 
 "md5", "sha1", "sha256", "sha-256", "sha512", "sha-512"

 For example: <authentication hash="sha">

 To hash passwords for this format, run these commands:
 "md5"                    read mypass; echo -n $mypass | md5sum
 "sha" or "sha1"          read mypass; echo -n $mypass | shasum
 "sha256" or "sha-256"    read mypass; echo -n $mypass | sha256sum
 "sha512" or "sha-512"    read mypass; echo -n $mypass | sha512sum

  After changing this file, the rudder webapp must be restarted to take changes
  into account: /etc/init.d/jetty restart

<!-- example with hash -->
<!-- <authentication hash="sha"> -->
<authentication>
  <user name="jon.doe"  password="secret"  role="administrator" />
  <user name="alex.bar" password="secret2" role="read_only"/>
  <user name="bob.foo"  password="secret3" role="user,validator"/>

  Authorizations
    You must define a role attribute to every user you add.
  A role is defined by a list of authorizations separated by commas.
  There's two kind of authorizations : 
  
  Predefined authorizations
  
  	there's 7 predefined authorization:
      - administrator (all rights)
      - administration_only (all administration)
      - user (all node, configuration)
      - configuration(all configuration)
      - read_only (read all)
      - compliance(read rule)
      - inventory (read node)

    There is three predefined roles for change request rights:
      - validator (Can valid changes)
      - deployer  (Can deploy changes)
      - workflow  (Both deployer and validator)
    The administrator role include the workflow ones

  Custom authorizations

    Custom authorisations are composed of two elements:
    - A type of authorization, which define what is concerned
        there's is 10 types, which are : node, group, deployement,
        administration, configuration, rule, technique, directive,
        validator and deployer.
    - A level of authorization, 
        levels are: read, write, edit, all(read, write, edit)
        They are not inclusive (write and edit don't include read,)
    a custom authorisation has a format like that "type_level" like "node_all", "group_read"

  Examples

    Some predefined users :
      <user name="jon.doe"  password="secret" role="administrator" />
      <user name="alex.bar" password="secret2" role="read_only"/>
      <user name="bob.foo"  password="secret3" role="user,validator"/>

    A custom user :
      - can read everything but administration,groups and deployement
      - can do everything about node

      <user name="custom" password="custom" role="node_all,configuration_read,rule_read,rule_edit,directive_read,technique_read">
