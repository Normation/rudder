  The "authentication" tag should have a "hash" attribute, with these allowed values:
    "md5", "sha1", "sha256", "sha-256", "sha512", "sha-512"

  Not specifying the "hash" attribute means using plain text passwords, which is not
  adviseable for security reasons.

  To create a sha512 hash of your password, please run this command:
    read mypass; echo -n $mypass | sha512sum

  If you configured the use of LDAP or Active Directory in rudder-web.properties file,
  you still need to specify here one user entry by user, with both the "password"
  field (which will be ignored - it can be left empty) and the "role" field
  (where you define the actual authorisations of the user). The "hash" field of
  "authentication" can be omitted.


  The "role" tag must contain one or more of these values (comma separated), depending
  on the what the user should be allowed to do:
    "administrator" (all rights), "administration_only" (administration tab), "user"
    (all nodes, configuration tab), "configuration" (configuration tab), "read_only"
    (read everything), "compliance" (read rules), "inventory" (read nodes), "validator"
    (can valid changes), "deployer" (can deploy changes), "workflow" (both deployer and validator)

  There is also the possibility to create "custom" roles by combining those elements:
    type: "node", "group", "deployment", "administration", "configuration", "rule", "technique"
    "directive", "validator", "deployer",
    level: "read", "write", "edit", "all" (read, write, edit)

  Example: "node_read" (can read nodes), "validator_all" (same as validator)

  Please take a look at Rudder's documentation for additional details, either from the
  application itself (upper right corner) or on
  http://www.rudder-project.org/rudder-doc-latest/rudder-doc.html#user-management.

  IMPORTANT: After changing this file, the rudder webapp must be restarted to take changes
  into account: /etc/init.d/rudder-jetty restart
