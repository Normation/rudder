    This is the default logging configuration file. It will be used if you
    didn't specify the "logback.configurationFile" JVM option. 
    For example, to use a loggin configuration file in "/etc/rudder":
    java ... -Dlogback.configurationFile=/etc/rudder/logback.xml

    Appender configuration - where&how to write logs in SLF4J speaking.
    ===================================================================
    Our default configuration : log on stdout appender so that our logs
    are managed by the container log system (and so, if Tomcat/Jetty/etc
    logs are stored in files and rotated, so are our log information).
    
    Log format is:
    - date/time/thread of the log on 30 chars (fixed)
    - log level on 5 char (fixed)
    - name of the logger (and so the class) on 36 chars, with
      package name folding
    - log message follows
    - limit exception trace to 30 calls
    
    You should not have to modify that.
